## Theme

An accessible rage game, developed entirely in Java without using any game engine. Inspired by *“Getting Over It”* and *Angry Birds*, it puts the player in control of a great tree that must help Peep, a small bird that fell from its nest. To do so, the player must catapult her between its branches until she’s reunited with her family. Do you have what it takes to help little Peep?

## My Role

In this project, I was in charge of all the programming as well as the game design. However, I will focus only on describing my role as a programmer.

- Camera system design and implementation from scratch.  
- Implementation of physics and collisions using the "física" library.  
- Programming of animations and particle systems.  
- Development of game mechanics.  
- General project programming.
